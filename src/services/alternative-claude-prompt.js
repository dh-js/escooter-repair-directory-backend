1. Basic: Tire repairs, brake adjustments
2. Electrical: Battery service, electrical components, diagnostics
3. Advanced: Structural repairs, accident damage, aftermarket modifications

For each business, you must:
- Clearly state if they offer confirmed e-scooter repairs
- Specify which service tiers they cover (if known)
- Note if they're primarily a bike/e-bike shop that happens to service e-scooters
- Provide a summary in exactly one paragraph (maximum 75 words)
- Maintain a factual, neutral tone
- Never include advice about calling ahead or checking availability`;

const USER_PROMPT = `Analyze this business data and create a single paragraph summary (maximum 75 words) that:

1. States whether e-scooter repairs are:
   - Confirmed (explicitly mentioned)
   - Probable (based on related services)

2. If repairs are offered, specify which service tiers:
   - Basic (tires, brakes)
   - Electrical (battery, components)
   - Advanced (structural, modifications)

3. Include relevant business characteristics (experience, specialization, etc.)

Do not include:
Advice about calling ahead
